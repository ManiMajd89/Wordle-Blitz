## Wordle Blitz
Mani's Wordle Game: This Python program is a custom implementation of the popular Wordle game, inspired by the New York Times version. Players guess a 5-letter word, receiving color-coded feedback for each guess: red for correct letters in the correct position, yellow for correct letters in the wrong position, and no color for incorrect letters. The game allows up to 6 guesses to find the correct word, with the option to display the correct word if the player fails to guess it within the allowed attempts.
